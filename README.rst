Hyper Documentation
===================

This repository contains the top-level documentation home page for the hyper
project. From this site, all other hyper projects are reachable directly.

The purpose of this site is to contain anything that is sufficiently general to
apply to all hyper projects, and thereby to avoid reproducing it a large number
of times. Information that is specific to a single project should not be placed
in this repository: instead, it should be added to the project in question.
