# hyper Logos

This folder contains SVG vector graphics of the hyper logo, stylized by an
italic word "hyper" in all lower-case letters, framed above and below with red
half cirlces or arcs.

The *primary* and default style is a *black letters on white background*, see
the files `hyper-black-bg-white` and `hyper-black-bg-transparent`.

If your usage requires an inverted color view, please use white letters with
transparent background if the background is already bright / light colored. If
the existing background is "colorful", please use a solid white background for
the logo. If, and only if your background is black, you can use white letters
with black background. Only in special situations with potential usability or
readability issues, please use gray letters on either transparent or white
background.

If possible, please use the vector file for your design (SVG file), otherwise
use the pre-rendered PNG with high resolution, or render your own, e.g.,
`inkscape -o output.png -d 150 hyper-gray-bg-white.svg`.
